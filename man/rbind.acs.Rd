\title{Combine acs Objects by Rows or Columns}
\usage{
\method{rbind}{acs}(e1, e2)
}
\arguments{
\item{e1, e2}{two acs-class objects}
}
\value{
Returns a single new acs object with all of the data contained in
the two arguments.
}
\description{
Take a pair of acs objects and combine by _c_olumns or _r_ows,
respectively.
}
\details{
When passed two acs-class objects, rbind (and cbind) will first check to
confirm whether the objects contain compatible data: same endyear and span;
same column names (for rbind) or geography (for cbind).  If not, it will
issue a warning, but will still proceed.

After this check, the function will return a new acs object that has
resulted from combining the two arguments row-wise or column-wise.  The
effect is essentially the same as rbind (or cbind) on the underlying
estimate and standard.error matrices, with all the additional acs metadata
tended to.
